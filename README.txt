THE PROGRAM IS A BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF AN 'AIRBNB' MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Motivation: We have designed this project in the view of our experience for creating more user friendly interfaces.

Description: Our project is sample of the online site airbnb which is an online booking site for booking hotels and letting you review it. 
It first asks the user whether they have used the site for reviewing or booking a hotel. 
After this, depending on the input, the program proceeds to show the available hotels and the price rates.

Build status: 
No such significant errors as to point out. 

How it operates:
The user is first required to sign up, following which he/she can login anytime(even if the program is closed and reopened). 
The user then needs to login with his/her credentials.
The program first asks the user whether they have opened the site for booking a room in a hotel or for reviewing the hotel. 
If the user had come for reviewing, he can put in the review and would get noted. 
For booking, the program then asks the desired location and price ranges of the user. 
After getting the details, the program shows the available hotel rooms. 
The program then shows the bedroom types and asks the duration of the stay. 
Depending on the avaliability checked after receiving the inputs, the hotel shows him the rooms and is able to book the room.


Features:

So they can login anytime when the program is opened. 
The program uses a We have created a simple to use program where The basic vim editor and gcc and makefile tools are all that is required to use the program.
